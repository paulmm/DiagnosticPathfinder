DiagnosticPathfinder
====================

DESCRIPTION

The intent of Diagnostic Pathfinder software is to help students learn a process for diagnostic reasoning. It does so by providing the history and lab data for a case, and requiring that users follow certain steps in order to provide a rationale that explains the data.

Diagnostic Pathfinder (dP) is still used around the world at top Veterinary Schools. 

[ThinkSpace](http://www.thinkspace.org) is a fork of dP that will be a web-based, extrapolated version for other disciplines.
